; The result of this config file will be 21 total workers
; 10 will do all jobs except Sum
; 5 will do Sum only because of the dedicated_count in the [Sum] section
; 5 will do fetch_url only because of count in the [fetch_url] section
; 1 will do only reverse_string because of dedicated_count in the main section
